This first project:
- Builded a skybox, used normal map to create texture effect, write different fragment shaders. 
- Wrote a user interaction. The light source can also change by using "W" up, "S" down, "A" left, "D" right, "Q" back, "E" front.

This second project:
- Used a procedural to creat a kind of 2D cartoon result on 3D object, but with the light effect (tree's shadow)
- Animated perturbation by using sin(time), to make the Christmas tree swing with the music.
- set up music to .html, transform shadertoy to three.js, use effect plugins. 
- Wrote a user interaction. The light source can also change by using "W" up, "S" down, "A" left, "D" right, "Q" back, "E" front.
